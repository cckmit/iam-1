            ## Note: Use the built-in 'WeightCalculatorWebFilter' to implement canary publishing. This should not be the most elegant 
            ## choice. For example, in some scenarios, the client request URL will not change, so it is impossible to implement
            ## canary traffic based on this router. Instead, Iscg's dedicated 'CanaryLoadBalancerFilter' should be used, 
            ## which supports dynamic matching of any HTTP request based on SPEL expressions, which is very flexible.
